# AR_Poly.Pizza_App
This AR-based mobile app lets users search for and interact with 3D objects using their phone's camera. Users can type in the search bar to find models from Poly Pizza, see image previews of the results, and tap on a model to place it into the AR scene. Once it's loaded, users can move and scale the model using simple gestures, as well as rotate the model using on-screen arrow buttons. The app features a clean and user-friendly design, with smooth search functionality and scrollable model previews, making it easy to explore 3D objects in an interactive AR environment.
